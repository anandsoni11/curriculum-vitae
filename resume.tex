\section{Professional Experience}

\cventry{May 2014--August 2014}{Google Summer of Code}{Mlpack : A C++ machine learning library}{}{}{
\begin{itemize}
  \item Improved the existing automatic benchmarking framework by implementing new performance metrics for various classification algorithms. Implemented one vs. all technique to convert multiclass classifiers into binary classifiers
  \item Developed a Bootstrapping framework in Python and d3.js to rank and compare the performance of various other machine learning libraries like Scikit and Matlab with MLPack
\end{itemize}
}

\cventry{May 2014--July 2014}{Intuit India Product Development Center}{Bangalore, India}{}{}{
\begin{itemize}
  \item Worked as a part of the Intuit Data Services team for the development of an error analysis and tracking tool for the QuickBooks Desktop care team
  \item Developed REST based end points using Jersey and Splunk APIs. Integrated the end points with a user interface developed using AngularJS. Mavenized both the projects for automatic deployment
  \item Ideated and developed QUANT (QuickBooks Analytics Tool) for the small businesses to grow based on their current business, customers and competitors data, during Incubation Week at Intuit IDC, Bangalore. Discussed the idea with Scott Cook, Founder, Intuit 
  \item Offered a full time position (Pre Placement Offer) in recognition of my performance
\end{itemize}
}

\section{Research Experience}
\cventry{Jul \'14--Nov \'14}{Undergraduate Thesis - I}{\newline Guide : Prof. Umesh Bellur}{CSE, IIT Bombay}{}{
\begin{itemize}
  \item Worked on the experimental comparison of various optimization techniques to minimize the host VM’s downtime and the total migration time for live migration
  \item Implemented a framework to analyze memory dumps obtained during migration for amount of dirtiness and existence of duplicate pages (full-page, sub-page and chunk-level)
  \item Implemented an optimization over the pre-copy approach which uses the merge sort algorithm to sort page groups based on their dirty counts
  \end{itemize}
}

\cventry{Jan \'15--Present}{Undergraduate Thesis - II}{\newline Guide : Prof. Umesh Bellur}{CSE, IIT Bombay}{}{
\begin{itemize}
  \item Worked on the empirical evaluation of Light Weight Containers (LWCs) vs. Virtual Machines (VMs) on the grounds of shared memory usage and under various workloads. The evaluation was done with and without u-KSM enabled in the kernel
  \item Currently, working on solving the problem of data center evacuation (VM migration) given a topology and a deadline
  \item Implemented a Linear Programming solution to determine the rates at which each VM should be migrated, given the deadline
  \item Simulated the migration of Virtual Machines in a given data center topology with each VM migrating through the best available path in terms of network bandwidth
  \end{itemize}
}

\section{Key Academic Projects}
\cventry{Jan \'14--Apr \'14}{Simulation of Virtual Memory and File System, Operating Systems Lab}{\newline Guide : Prof. D M Dhamdhere, CSE, IIT Bombay}{}{}{
\begin{itemize}
  \item Simulated the virtual memory organization in C. Implemented the page management and page replacement policies, allocation of physical memory, page tables and page faults
  \item Also simulated the basic features of a file system to create, move and delete files and directories
\end{itemize}
}

\cventry{Jul \'13--Nov \'13}{FileMesh – Sharing Files over the Network, Computer Networks Lab}{\newline Guide : Prof. Kameshwari Chebrolu, CSE, IIT Bombay}{}{}{
\begin{itemize}
  \item Developed a file sharing system to store and retrieve files to and from multiple servers using sockets
  \item Implemented UDP protocol for Store and TCP protocol for Get requests. Stored files as md5sums
\end{itemize}
}

\cventry{Jul \'13--Nov \'13}{Travel Planner Webapp, Database and Information Systems Lab}{\newline Guide : Prof. Umesh Bellur, CSE, IIT Bombay}{}{}{

  \item Worked with a large data of all the cities, states and countries of the world
\end{itemize}
}

\cventry{Jul \'13--Nov \'13}{Buffer Overflow Attacks, Computer Architecture Lab}{\newline Guide : Prof. Bernard Menezes, CSE, IIT Bombay}{}{}{
\begin{itemize}
  \item Analyzed program stack on a Linux x86 machine and implemented shell codes to implement a buffer overflow attack executing the sys\_rmdir system call 
  \item Studied defence mechanisms against such attacks
\end{itemize}
}

\cventry{Jul \'12--Nov \'12}{Data Compression System, Data Structures \& Algorithms Lab}{\newline Guide : Prof. Varsha Apte, CSE, IIT Bombay}{}{}{
\begin{itemize}
