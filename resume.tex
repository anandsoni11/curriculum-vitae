\section{Professional Experience}

\cventry{May 2014--August 2014}{Google Summer of Code}{Mlpack : A C++ machine learning library}{}{}{
\begin{itemize}
  \item Improved the existing automatic benchmarking framework by implementing new performance metrics for various classification algorithms. Implemented one vs. all technique to convert multiclass classifiers into binary classifiers
  \item Developed a Bootstrapping framework in Python and d3.js to rank and compare the performance of various other machine learning libraries like Scikit and Matlab with MLPack
\end{itemize}
}

\cventry{May 2014--July 2014}{Intuit India Product Development Center}{Bangalore, India}{}{}{
\begin{itemize}
  \item Worked as a part of the Intuit Data Services team for the development of an error analysis and tracking tool for the QuickBooks Desktop care team
  \item Developed REST based end points using Jersey and Splunk APIs. Integrated the end points with a user interface developed using AngularJS. Mavenized both the projects for automatic deployment
  \item Ideated and developed QUANT (QuickBooks Analytics Tool) for the small businesses to grow based on their current business, customers and competitors data, during Incubation Week at Intuit IDC, Bangalore. Discussed the idea with Scott Cook, Founder, Intuit 
  \item Offered a full time position (Pre Placement Offer) in recognition of my performance
\end{itemize}
}

\section{Research Experience}
\cventry{July 2014--November 2014}{Undergraduate Thesis - I}{\newline Guide : Prof. Umesh Bellur}{}{}{
\begin{itemize}
  \item Worked on the experimental comparison of various optimization techniques to minimize the host VM’s downtime and the total migration time for live migration
  \item Implemented a framework to analyze the rate at which pages get dirty which can be used to dynamically change the migration rate
  \end{itemize}
}

\cventry{January 2015--Present}{Undergraduate Thesis - II}{\newline Guide : Prof. Umesh Bellur}{}{}{
\begin{itemize}
  \item Worked on the experimental comparison of various optimization techniques to minimize the host VM’s downtime and the total migration time for live migration
